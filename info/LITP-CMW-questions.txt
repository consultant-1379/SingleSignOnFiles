LITP / CMW questions
====================

* How to add Apache / mod_ssl to landscape/campaign/deployment
  - request it from LITP?

* How best to define custom JBoss instance
  - Define requirements in plain English and provide this to LITP/CMW?
  - Provide exact example of configuration needed? (changes to standalone-full-ha.xml and addition to $JBOSS_HOME/modules/sun/jdk/main/modules.xml)
  - Perform modifications as part of installation scripts?

* Should JBoss instance br outside of CMW cluster?

* Best way to configure firewall rules/ports opened?
  - Request them as part of LITP deployment/delivery?
  - Add LITP commands (litp /definition/os/osms/fw_basetcp update dport etc)

* Best way to configure SELinux?
  - Same two points as above (but not LITP commands, standard SELinux config commands)



What we would like to have as a baseline
========================================

* JBoss configured

* Apache installed, mod_ssl configured and valid certificate installed

* All required ports to be opened in iptables

* The UI login screen deployed and the web location known to us




What environment information do we need to know to automate installation
========================================================================

COM-INF LDAP uri, ports, admin username/password, root suffix

User store type (e.g., LDAPv3ForOpenDS)

Location of OpenAM installation (directory on file system which jboss user can write to)
