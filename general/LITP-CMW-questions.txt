LITP / CMW questions
====================

* How to add Apache / mod_ssl to landscape/campaign/deployment
  - request it from LITP?

* How best to define custom JBoss instance
  - Define requirements in plain English and provide this to LITP/CMW?
  - Provide exact example of configuration needed? (changes to standalone-full-ha.xml and addition to $JBOSS_HOME/modules/sun/jdk/main/modules.xml)
  - Perform modifications as part of installation scripts?

* Should JBoss instance be outside of CMW cluster?

* Best way to configure firewall rules/ports opened?
  - Request them as part of LITP deployment/delivery?
  - Add LITP commands (litp /definition/os/osms/fw_basetcp update dport etc)

* Best way to configure SELinux?
  - Same two points as above (but not LITP commands, standard SELinux config commands)




What we would like to have as a baseline
========================================

* JRE 1.6 (latest update) extracted somewhere we can reference with a local $JAVA_HOME variable
  - can be removed after final OpenAM / Policy Agent configuration

* Single standalone JBoss configured
  - Two extensions and subsystems removed - jaxrs/org.jboss.as.jaxrs and webservices/org.jboss.as.webservices
  - Entry added to $JBOSS_HOME/modules/sun/jdk/main/module.xml
    '<path name="sun/security/x509"/>'
  - the above configurations are only needed when deploying to JBoss/other JEE container. Not needed for JSE container e.g., Tomcat

* Apache installed, mod_ssl configured and valid certificate installed

* All required ports to be opened in iptables

* The UI login screen deployed and the web location known to us






What environment information do we need to know to automate installation
========================================================================

COM-INF LDAP uri, ports, admin username/password, root suffix

User store type (e.g., LDAPv3ForOpenDS)

Location of OpenAM installation (directory on file system which jboss user can write to)





Risks
=====

Post-installation of Policy Agent
---------------------------------

* Need to configure SELinux to allow new httpd module to load:
	# setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect true
	# chcon -u system_u -t httpd_config_t /path/to/Agent_00x/config/*
	# chcon -u system_u -t httpd_modules_t /path/to/policy-agent/lib/*
	# chcon -R -t httpd_log_t /path/to/policy-agent/Agent-00x/logs

* Need to add config file to /etc/httpd/conf.d/10_sso_enabled.conf

* Need to modify properties files to configure SSL and sub-realm (OpenAM-specific term)

Will these changes persist once Apache httpd is part of a CoreMiddleWare campaign?


Environment information
-----------------------

If we choose the OpenAM installation directory and change the system ownership (to say, jboss-eap:jboss-eap), will this change in ownership persist under CMW/LITP? (It hasn't been a problem so far in the LITP sprint releases)

Installation of Policy Agent attempts to modify main httpd.conf file (which we need to go back and undo via a script). Once Apache httpd is under CMW, will this break any scripts attempting to modify it?

PA also needs Apache httpd to be shutdown during installation. Will this be possible once Apache httpd is under CMW?
